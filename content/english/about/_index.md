## About Dalyle DevOps Inc.

....

Incorporated in October 2021, after a tumultuous few years, focused purely on work, excluding ALL personal relationships, friendships, and family. Becoming my own person, fully, and finding my life purpose, to make the Web Industry Better. Better for Clients, Agencies, Contractors, Stakeholders, and in a way, most importantly, the end user/visitor.

Finding DevOps in the summer of 2020 changed my life. More than I knew, and possibly more than I still know. I read physical books, Kindle books, audio books, articles, YouTube videos, and so much more. I immersed myself in DevOps, Agile, Lean, Six Sigma, and Dry-walling, to finish my garage, with a beautiful "Level 5" like finish. Some books include, roughly in the order I read them:

* "The Phoenix Project"
  * Narrative intro to DevOps
  * Follow-up to "
* DevOps Handbook

More books, up-to-date mainly, available on my [GoodReads.com Profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/88997684-greg-stevens).

Sincerely,

Greg
